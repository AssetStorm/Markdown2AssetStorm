Heading
=======

This is text with **important** content. It needs to be *blockwise emphasized* 
and even ***strong and emphasized***. It contains `inline code` and a 
[link](https://ct.de "Link with alternate text").

## smaller Heading

![This is the caption for an image.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Cscr-featured.png/50px-Cscr-featured.png)

The text continues below the second heading.

```python
import json
print(
  json.dumps({"key": "value"})
)
```

Not only listings can be embedded. Citations are pretty interesting too:

> This is a citation
> 
> which spans over two blocks.

After that the text continues a usual.
